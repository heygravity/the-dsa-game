# SortSaga - A Fun Way to Learn DSA

SortSaga is an interactive, single-page web application designed to teach the Bubble Sort algorithm in a hands-on, engaging, and visual way. Instead of just reading about the theory, users can play a simple game that directly mimics the algorithm's logic, helping to build a stronger mental model of how it works.
